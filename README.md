# Sai Pandian's Physics Notes Archive

This repository is for a static website that hosts my handwritten notes for
modules undertaken as part of the BSc Physics course at the University of
Southampton. These notes may be useful for students doing the course for the
first time or for students revising as part of their Synoptic exams.

The website is accessible [here](https://saiduc.github.io/Physics-Notes/).

## How should you use my notes?

When I wrote my notes, I did so without the expectation that anyone would ever
read them besides myself. So there are some quirks that suit my learning
style. I may have skipped over a topic you find challenging but I found easier
to understand and then devoted a lot of time to something you understand easily
but I did not at the time of writing.

Because of this, I would STRONGLY recommend that you write your own notes. When
it came time to do my exams, I barely referred to my notes once I had written
them. I found that the best revision came from actually making these notes, as
it meant I had to put down on paper everything I knew about a topic, showing
where all the gaps in my knowledge were. I therefore think you should only use
these notes as a supplementary resource to your own practice.

Please also keep in mind that I made these notes when I was a student, the same
as you, so there may be some mistakes in them.
